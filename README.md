# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:

Download and split the dataset into training and testing datasets
### STEP 2:

rescale the data as that the training is made easy
### STEP 3:

create the model for the program , in this experiment we create to networks , one for encoding and one for decoding Write your own steps
